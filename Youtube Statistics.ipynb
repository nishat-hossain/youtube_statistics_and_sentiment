    "While previously we saw that the 'reaction', 'chess','nintendo','trolling', and 'marvel' categories had the top 5 like-to-comments ratios, here those categories fall towards the lower end of positive sentiment, with trolling having only 48% positive sentiment. Instead, different top categories emerge when we look through the lens of comment sentiment analysis: challenge, learning, food, music, and ASMR. This shows that likes alone does not give us a complete picture. Looking at sentiment in the comments section allows us to build a more complete picture of audience & consumer sentiment.  \n",

    "Similarly, while Mr.Beast videos were the most viewed and liked, and also had the most liked comments, surprisingly other categories beat out Mr.Beast in terms of positive sentiment. One potential cause for this could be that niche categories like \"machine learning\" and \"lo-fi\" are simply more likely to have a highely invested audience. It's also interesting to see non-Mr.Beast challenge videos beat out Mr.Beast content in terms of sentiment: again, it could simply be owing to a niche, loyal fan-base."
